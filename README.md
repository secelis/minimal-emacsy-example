Minimal Emacsy Example Program
==============================

This program contains an example program for the proposed [Emacsy
project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/568774734/emacsy-an-embeddable-emacs).
It is written as a literate program using the `nuweb`.  It's probably
best to use [my copy of nuweb](http://github.com/secelis/nuweb) since
I've made a few changes.
